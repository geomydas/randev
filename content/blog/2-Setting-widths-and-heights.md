## 1. `width:`

You would often use this with `max-width:` most of the time. Setting fixed widths such as `width: 320px` or `width: 2rem` is rarely done and not even reccomended as you would likely use `max-width:` for it. Use fixed widths for smaller stuff like icons and avatars which rarely cause overflow.

## 2. `min-width`

## 3. `max-width:`

## 4. `height`

## 5. `min-height`

## 6. `max-height`
