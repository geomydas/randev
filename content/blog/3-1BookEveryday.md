## Guide

- Read a book each day
- If you miss a day, read 2 books tomorrow. If you miss again, read 3 books the next day.
- Read a variety of books
  - Fiction
  - Non-fiction
  - Classics
  - Modern
  - Short
  - Long
- If you want to read a long book but you think you are unable to do it in a day, read it on other days while reading other books.
- Get your books from a library, book store, website, [https://annas-archive.org/](https://annas-archive.org/), or wherever you want.
- Read from a laptop, phone, physical book, Kindle, or wherever you want.
- Get your book suggestions wherever you want but I suggest [https://goodreads.com/list](https://goodreads.com/list)
- Write about the book you finished reading. Summarize it, explain the chapters, highlight quotes, and etc.

## What I've done

I write about the notes from the book on this website and publish it as a blog. I go on [https://goodreads.com/list](https://goodreads.com/list) for reccomendations then get the book on [https://annas-archive.org/](https://annas-archive.org/). After I get the eBook, I connect my *Kindle Paperwhite 11th gen* to my computer and upload it. Sometimes I go the library for books that I cannot find online.
